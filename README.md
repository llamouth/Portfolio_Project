# 👋 Hey there! I'm Larry Lamouth

Welcome to the code behind [larrylamouth.com](https://www.larrylamouth.com) — my personal portfolio site where I showcase who I am, what I build, and the things that inspire me as a full stack developer based in Brooklyn, NY 🌆.

## 🌟 About This Project

This site is my digital playground — a place to share my story, highlight my favorite projects, and connect with folks who are just as excited about tech, creativity, and clean code as I am.

It’s built to be:

- **Simple & Clear** – Because good UX starts with thoughtful design.
- **Responsive** – Works beautifully on desktops, tablets, and phones.
- **Accessible** – Everyone should be able to explore what I create.
- **Fast & Performant** – Optimized to load quickly and run smoothly.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Here's what powers this site:

- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, SCSS, Bootstrap
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express (when needed)
- **Database (for some projects):** PostgreSQL
- **Deployment:** Vercel / Netlify

## 📁 Featured Projects

A few things you’ll find on the site:

- **YumStepper** – A fun, fitness-forward mobile app that rewards you for staying active.
- **BudgetYaSelf** – A budgeting tool that makes personal finance a little less scary.
- **Tuner App** – A full-stack music app using RESTful routes and SQL.

Each project is something I’ve poured heart and code into — they reflect my growth, curiosity, and commitment to building cool stuff that solves real problems.

## ✍️ Blog / Writing

I occasionally write about my dev journey, like overcoming imposter syndrome and staying motivated during the job hunt. Check it out [here](https://medium.com/@llamouth) if you’re into real talk + tech.
